# AI-Powered-Triage-System-for-Emergency-Departments
## Overview
The goal of this project is to create an AI-assisted triage system that helps emergency department nurses assess patient conditions and prioritize care. Using machine learning and NLP, the system analyzes patient symptoms, medical history, and vital signs to predict triage levels, allowing for a more efficient and accurate prioritization process.

## Steps

### Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
1. **Collect Data**: Gather historical triage data from hospital records, including symptoms, vital signs, patient demographics, initial nurse assessments, and final triage levels.
2. **Anonymization**: Ensure patient data privacy by anonymizing personal identifiers in the dataset.
3. **Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and standardize data, removing inconsistencies.
   - Tokenize and preprocess any text-based symptom descriptions or notes using NLP libraries like `spaCy` or `NLTK`.

### Step 2: Feature Engineering
1. **Symptoms and Vital Signs**: Extract key features from symptoms and vital sign data (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, etc.).
2. **Categorization**: Label data according to triage levels (e.g., 1 for critical, 2 for urgent, 3 for less urgent, etc.).
3. **Encoding**: Convert categorical features, such as age group and gender, into numerical representations if needed.


### Step 3: Model Selection and Training
1. **Choose a Model**: Train a machine learning model, such as Random Forest, SVM, or Logistic Regression, to classify triage levels. Alternatively, use a deep learning model like an LSTM for sequential analysis if text data (e.g., symptoms) plays a significant role.
2. **Split Data**: Use an 80-20 train-test split to evaluate model performance.


### Step 4: Model Evaluation
1. **Evaluate Accuracy**: Calculate model accuracy on the test data to assess generalization.
2. **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: Use classification metrics to evaluate how well the model performs across different triage levels.


### Step 5: Deploy the Model
1. **API Development**: Deploy the model using an API (e.g., FastAPI or Flask) so it can integrate with hospital management systems.
2. **Input Interface**: Develop an easy-to-use form where nurses can enter patient symptoms and vital signs, with the API returning the predicted triage level.

### Step 6: Real-time Data Handling and Alerts
1. **Thresholds and Alerts**: Set up threshold levels for each triage category. If a patient is classified as critical, the system can immediately alert medical staff.
2. **Dashboard**: Develop a dashboard showing triage levels for incoming patients, updated in real-time.

### Step 7: Continuous Model Improvement
1. **Feedback Loop**: Integrate a feedback loop for nurse confirmation or reassessment of triage levels to refine and retrain the model.
2. **Regular Updates**: Regularly retrain the model with new data to improve its predictive accuracy and adapt to any changes in patient profiles.


## Conclusion
This AI-powered triage system offers a streamlined, data-driven approach to prioritizing emergency department patients. By providing nurses with an automated assessment tool, the system can enhance decision-making accuracy, reduce wait times for critical cases, and improve overall patient outcomes.
